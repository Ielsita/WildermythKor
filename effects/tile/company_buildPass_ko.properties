No helmets though. I need to see everyone's hair.../I found a geode once. I mean I think I did. I didn't want to break it. What's your best rock?>/[face:skeptical]<leader.bookish/healer/snark:Let's think about the benefits of opening a road here. Is it worth it? Are there possibly better locations?/It's a commitment, but I think it'll bring us good will. Good will can buy you a lot in times of need./Let the locals help, if they want a pass. Or is this for us? We could charge folks to use it, I suppose?>/[face:happy]<leader.coward/hothead/poet:It'll be good to have a way through. Good for everyone, I hope. Good idea also to keep it watched, and perhaps defended./This could mean a lot to folks. They'll probably want to help. Be done before any of us can blink, I'm sure./The flow of supplies, medicines, migrants. This is [i]why[] we're here. To help people.>/[face:dubious]<leader.bookish/loner/romantic:I'm all for a challenge, but this is a waste of our seasons-honed skills, isn't it?/Weeks breaking rocks and sweating our clothes stiff in the mountains? Waste of effort. We'll find a way around./I'm here to slay monsters and earn songs. I'll [i]supervise[] maybe...>/[face:happy]<leader.whm:I can turn these arms to roadmaking, if others will join me. We'll see it done./Shale around here's treacherous. But with some thought and muscle. We can definitely do it./Stone-spirits are stubborn. I can probably keep folks safe here, if heavy arms help with the lifting.>/[face:grim]<leader.whm:I'll take on the mountain. Probably faster just working alone./It's tough climbing, isn't it? Well... I can show folks where to dig through, if I have to./The rock doesn't like to change. I understand it best of anyone, perhaps.>/[face:grim]<leader.coward/loner/romantic:I don't know. There's a reason the mountains grew up where they did. Some things were meant to stay apart. Or stay buried.../Isn't it pride that drives us to try and change the shape of the land? We're not gods./Beneath the land lies a hidden world. Damp, vast, full of sunless vegetation. I worry what happens if a chance blow uproots the darkness.>/[face:happy]<leader.bookish/leader/loner:The symbolism itself will be good for us, our lands, our people. Carving a way through is what we [i]do[]./I dreamed, once, of a distant land over the mountains.

Suppose the good thing about busting rocks is that they don't bust back./Picking the right way through the mountains has always been more art than science.
