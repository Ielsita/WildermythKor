~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_003~1_hero3=Hang on.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_004~1_hero3=Something over this way.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_005~1_narration=A squeeze through the rock takes them into a scraped-out room.

~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_019~1_npc4=Oh, lots of places.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_020~1_npc4=I can draw you the way to our room though, it should be well-locked. Let me find a scrap of something.

~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_024~1_npc4=I’ve got some artifacts too, bit of a collection in the chest by the door. Honored if any of them could help you.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_025~1_npc3=Good luck!
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_026~1_narration=The map's lines snap the tunnels into place.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_027~1_narration=And as hoped...
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_028~1_narration=...they find themselves in a snug room, greeted by the scent of old paper.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_028~2_hero=Wardrobe door? Nice touch.
~04~player_chose_one.random_1~panel_029~1_narration=<hero> pokes around as they discuss the best way to venture out.
